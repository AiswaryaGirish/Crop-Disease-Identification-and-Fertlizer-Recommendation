# Leaf Disease Identification and Fertilizer Recommendation System.
This project aims to develop a system for identifying leaf diseases in plants and recommending suitable fertilizers based on the diagnosis. The system utilizes machine learning models to analyze images of plant leaves and provide insights into potential diseases and appropriate fertilization strategies.

# Features
Leaf Disease Identification**: The system can identify various diseases affecting plant leaves,by analyzing images of the leaves.
Fertilizer Recommendation**: Based on the diagnosed disease and other factors such as plant type and soil conditions, the system recommends suitable fertilizers to mitigate the disease and promote plant health.

# Usage
1. Image Upload**: Users can upload images of plant leaves through the ml model.
2. Disease Identification**: The system processes the uploaded images using machine learning algorithms to identify any diseases present in the leaves.
3. Fertilizer Recommendation**: After disease identification, the system recommends appropriate fertilizers to address the diagnosed diseases and enhance plant growth.
